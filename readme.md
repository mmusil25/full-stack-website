 Full Stack Website
===========
## Conclusions
The internet has entered an age where generic, predictable websites are no longer attractive or effective. An entrepreneur must be fluent in web developed if they intend on convincing others that they are technologically savvy. Gone are the days of specialized technical skills. If the goal is to open up one's employment options, full stack web development is a core skill. 

### Background

A while back I was joking around with a friend and he mentioned that it would hilarious if I could stream anime 24/7 from my computer. The topic can come up after I tried to install an Arma 3 server on my main desktop and failed miserably. It got me thinking about the nature of servers and what sort of challenges they respresent. 

Around the same time, I published the original landing page for my computer sales business and I also ran a few ad campaigns on Google ads and on Facebook Marketplace. The adds did well and I received around 400 clicks on my ads throughout about a week of air time. I did not make a sale. This experience made me realize that a wordpress website hosted on a mid-tier hosting platform would not work to convince someone to pay me thousands of dollars to build a PC. I needed a better website. 

I've also been looking to prepare for my upcoming SysML certification exam and this was a perfect modelling project. 

### Goal

Build a website { [markmusil.com](markmusil.com) } that hosts my personal portfolio, a persistent anime stream, and a landing page advertising my computer business. 

### Methods
* Construct and maintain a system model
* Develop a sandbox for learning web development safely
* Finish a complete website available on the local network
* Reroute global DNS servers from markmusil.com's previous servers to a dedicated server in my room

### Subsection Details
* SysML discussion
* Hardware discussion
* Cybersecurity
* Back end development
* Front end development
